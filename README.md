# Pool Cleaners"R"Us

Welcome to Pool Cleaners"R"Us where we will turn into a scrubbing block and clean those filty pools. Our Super Scrub Block(SSB) is so good that you'll clean the pool with one single sweep. But here is the problem, it is so good that you won't stop going forward until you hit a wall.

Your job is to skillfully hit a wall so that you can clean the whole pool.

### MVP
- Render game screen with title, instructions, and play button
- Render stage with Super Scrub Block
- Move with WASD keys
- Stop SSB when it hits a wall
- When SSB goes over the grid changes color
- Win screen or next stage screen when pool is clean

---
### Stretch Goals
- Generate stage with math
- Let Player choose Pool color
- Have SSB trail with bubbles

---
### Potential roadblocks
- Changing color as the SSB goes over the grid
- Stoping the SSb at a wall
- Designing a map that is difficult and beatable

---
### Approach
I started the project with writing pseudo code of how the game should be played out. 
Put in simple layout of the game and started coding out the canvas.
Even though I didn't use any of the planning code it still helped me what to build first.
like what class to create and function. What to put in a interval to check constantly.

### Post Project Reflection
This project gave me some major roadblock of choices like how am I going to make this code reusable. I had to look at similar tutorial to get my idea into work. It was still challenging to make it usable for me and most importantly that I understands what is happening. I learned a lot about using canvas and the importance of rendering order.
